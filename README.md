# RainbowVis

Semestral work submitted in the course on visualization. The app allows to visualize activations and outputs from a CNN classifying MNIST digits and therefore to provide a better understanding of the model's behaviour.

The source data should be downloaded automatically. All data can be visualized as points in the square window. For efficient exploration you can use filtering in the left panel or get the precise values by pointing at the tiles in the right panel.
